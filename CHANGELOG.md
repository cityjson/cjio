# Changelog

## [0.10.0] â€“ <>
### Changed
- The command `medata_remove` was renamed to `metadata_extended_remove` and can be used to remove the deprecated extended metadata from older files
- Fixed the `texture_update` and `texture_locate` commands and also the `save` command with the `--texture` flag.
- Fixed the conversion from .poly input when the file has comments or 1- index. 

### Added
- More tests and coverage

### Removed:
- Support for extended metadata: specifically the commands `metadata_create` and  `metadata_update`
- All API functionality is derecated: cjio.models and some functions from cjio.cityjson have been removed. Also all related tests.


## [0.9.0] â€“ 2023-09-28
### Changed
- now CityJSON v2.0 is the default version
- fixes for gltf export
- fix the cjio subset and children
### Added
- added an upgrade ops for v2.0 files


## [0.8.2] â€“ 2023-07-13
### Changed
- Removed the emojis in the console output for the function 'info'


## [0.8.1] â€“ 2023-02-06
### Added
- Added the `translate` paramter to `cityjson.compress` to manually set the tranlation properties instead of computing from the data.
- The `cityjson.cityjson_for_features` and `cityjson.generate_features` methods.

### Changed
#### gltf (glb) converter
- `to_glb` sets a root transformation matrix for z-up to y-up, instead of swapping the vertex coordinates directly.
- Takes a `do_triangulate` argument to completely skip triangulation.
- Compute (smooth) normals.

## [0.8.0] â€“ 2022-11-28
### Added
- added functions for reading/writing CityJSONL (CityJSONFeatures) from stdin/stdout, so cjio can be part of a pipeline of operators processing 3D city models ðŸš€
### Changed
- many small bugs fixed
- The function that used an API are going to be deprecated in the upcoming releases, because the cjio API is under refactoring. The affected functions are `cityjson.save`, `cityjson.load`, `cityjson.save`, `cityjson.load_from_j`, `cityjson.get_cityobjects`, `cityjson.set_cityobjects`, `cityjson.to_dataframe`, `cityjson.reference_geometry`, `cityjson.add_to_j` and all members of the `cityjson.models` module. There is a new cityjson library under development, called cjlib, which will replace the relevant parts in cjio.


## [0.7.6] â€“ 2022-09-12
### Changed
- cjvalpy >=v0.3 is required to use the latest schemas (v1.1.2)
- fix the parsing of the validation string


## [0.7.5] â€“ 2022-08-08
### Added
- Subset more than one CityObject type (#9)
- `models.Geometry.reproject()` for reprojecting dereferenced geometry boundaries
- Read from `stdin` and save to `stdout`
- `--suppress_msg` to suppress all messages. Required when saving to `stdout`
### Fixed
- Subset with BBOX does not modify the input model anymore (#10)
- `cityjson.load()` does not fail on a `GeometryInstance`, however it does not load it either (#19)
- Fixes to the *glb* exporter (#20, #57, #83), and fixed the coordinate system
- `texture` and `material` are correctly removed from the geometries of the CityObjects with `textures/materials_remove`
- `vertex-texture` is removed from the CityJSON with `textures_remove`
- Docker image build (#77, #132)
- Other minor fixes
### Changed
- Export format is an argument, not an option (#35), e.g. `cjio ... export obj out.obj`
- NumPy is a hard requirement
- Require pyproj >= 3.0.0 (#142)
- Refactor warnings and alert printing (#143)


## [0.7.4] - 2022-06-20
### Fixed
- crash with new version of Click (>=8.1) (#140)
### Added
- templates for bug reporting

## [0.7.3] - 2021-12-15
### Fixed
- STL export (#127)

## [0.7.2] - 2021-12-02
### Fixed
- String representation of the CityJSON class works again

## [0.7.1] - 2021-12-01
### Fixed
- save operator was crashing for unknown reasons sometimes, this is fixed


## [0.7.0] - 2021-12-01
### Changed
- Minimum required CityJSON version is 1.1
- Many operators names changed, it's now "property-verb", so that all the operators related to textures for instance are together
- The metadata are only updated (with lineage) when there is a [metadata-extended](https://github.com/cityjson/metadata-extended) property in the file, otherwise nothing is modified
- The schema validator (operator `validate`) is not written in Python anymore and part of cjio, it's using [cjval](https://github.com/cityjson/cjval) and its [Python binding](https://github.com/cityjson/cjvalpy) (which needs to be installed). The validator is several orders of magniture faster too

### Added
- A new operator `triangulate` that triangulates each surface of the input (de-triangulate coming soon)

### Fixed
- Several bugs were fixed

### API
- Loading a file with `cityjson.load()` removes the `transform` property from the file


## [0.6.10] - 2021-10-18
### Changed
- Minimum required Python is 3.6

### Fixed
- Click option is set to None when empty (#99)
- Loading breaks on inconsistent semantics (#102)
- extract_lod doesn't work with the improved LoD (#80)

### API changes
- Added `CityJSON.load_from_j`
- Make transformation the default on loading a cityjson
- `CityJSON.add_to_j` includes `reference_geometry`, no need to call it separately

## [0.6.9] - 2021-07-06
### Changed
- version with schemas 1.0.3 (where metadata schema is fixed)
- fix bugs with operators `update_metadata_cmd()` and `get_metadata_cmd()` crashing

## [0.6.7] - 2021-03-12
### Changed
- fix bug: crash when validating files containing Extensions under Windows


## [0.6.0] - 2020-10-27
### Added
- Convert to Binary glTF (glb)
- Convert to Batched 3D Models (b3dm) - Output is probably incorrect though
- Progress bar for the `reproject` command
- Started a proof of concept for an API. You can read about the first struggles in `docs/design_document.ipynb`. Mainly implemented in `models` and a few additional methods in `cityjson`. Plus a bunch of tests for the API ([#13](https://github.com/cityjson/cjio/pull/13))
- Add tutorials and dedicated documentation 
- Docker image and Travis build for it ([#25](https://github.com/cityjson/cjio/pull/25))
- Generate metadata ([#56](https://github.com/cityjson/cjio/pull/56))
- STL export format ([#66](https://github.com/cityjson/cjio/pull/66))
### Changed
- click messages, warnings got their functions and placed into the `utils` module
- only EPSG codes are supported for the CRS's URN
- When `--indent` is passed to `save`, tabs are used instead of spaces. Results in smaller files.
### Fixes
- Fix precision when removing duplicates ([#50](https://github.com/cityjson/cjio/pull/60))
